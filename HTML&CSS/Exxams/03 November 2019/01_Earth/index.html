                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
                    According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years
                    ago.
                    Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth.
                    The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
                    orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
